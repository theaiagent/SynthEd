# SynthEd

**Agent-Based Synthetic Educational Data Generation for Open & Distance Learning Research**

SynthEd generates behaviorally coherent synthetic student data by combining **persona-driven agent modeling** (inspired by [TinyTroupe](https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe)) with **scalable multi-agent simulation** (inspired by [MiroFish](https://github.com/666ghj/MiroFish)). Unlike traditional synthetic data methods (GANs, VAEs), SynthEd produces temporally consistent interaction traces where each data point is grounded in a simulated student's personality, motivation, and life context.

## Why SynthEd?

Educational data mining research faces three persistent challenges:

| Challenge | Traditional Approach | SynthEd Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Privacy regulations** (GDPR/KVKK) restrict access to real student data | Anonymization (risk of re-identification) | Agents are fictional — no real individuals involved |
| **Class imbalance** — dropout events are rare | Oversampling (SMOTE) — loses behavioral context | Parameter-level control of dropout rates |
| **Temporal incoherence** — GAN/VAE outputs lack behavioral consistency | Post-hoc smoothing | Persona + memory system produces coherent trajectories |

## Key Features

- **Persona-Driven Agents**: Each student has Big Five personality traits, motivation type (SDT), self-efficacy, employment status, family responsibilities, and digital literacy — all influencing simulated behavior.
- **Temporal Memory**: Agents accumulate experiences across weeks, creating realistic engagement trajectories (e.g., a failed midterm reduces subsequent engagement).
- **Configurable Populations**: Calibrate to your institution's demographics using aggregate statistics only (no individual data needed).
- **Multi-Level Validation**: Automatic statistical comparison against reference data using KS-tests, chi-squared tests, correlation checks, and temporal coherence analysis.
- **Optional LLM Enrichment**: Use GPT-4o-mini to generate narrative backstories and richer behavioral nuance (off by default — zero API cost in rule-based mode).
- **Privacy by Design**: Synthetic agents are fictional constructs with no mapping to real individuals.

print(f"Validation: {report['validation']['summary']['overall_quality']}")
```

## Output Datasets

| File | Description | Rows | Use Case |
|------|-------------|------|----------|
| `students.csv` | Demographics, Big Five, motivation, self-efficacy | 1 per student | Feature engineering, clustering |
| `interactions.csv` | Timestamped LMS events (logins, posts, submissions) | ~50-100 per student/week | Sequence modeling, engagement analysis |

| `pipeline_report.json` | Full validation report and pipeline metadata | 1 | Quality assurance |

## Validation Suite

SynthEd validates generated data across four levels:

1. **Marginal Distributions** — KS-test for continuous variables, chi-squared for categorical
2. **Correlation Structure** — Verifies expected relationships (e.g., conscientiousness ↔ dropout)
3. **Temporal Coherence** — Dropout students should show declining engagement trajectories
4. **Privacy Assessment** — k-anonymity check on quasi-identifiers

Example validation output:
```
Quality: A (Excellent) — 12/13 tests passed
  ✓ age_distribution (KS-test, p=0.34)
  ✓ gender_distribution (Chi-squared, p=0.89)
  ✓ dropout_rate (Z-test, p=0.57)
  ✓ tinto_conscientiousness_dropout (r=-0.31, expected negative)
  ✓ bandura_self_efficacy_engagement (r=0.42, expected positive)
  ✓ rovai_self_regulation_engagement (r=0.35, expected positive)
  ✓ bean_metzner_financial_stress_dropout (r=0.18, expected positive)
  ✓ tinto_goal_commitment_engagement (r=0.28, expected positive)
  ✓ engagement_trajectory_divergence (retained > dropout)
  ✓ dropout_negative_trend_rate (82% show decline)
  ✓ k_anonymity (avg k=4.2)
```

## Theoretical Foundations

SynthEd's persona attributes and simulation mechanics are grounded in nine established theoretical anchors from ODE dropout research, organized into four factor clusters following Yıldız et al. (2022):

### Core Theoretical Anchors

| Anchor | Origin | Role in SynthEd |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Tinto's Student Integration Model** (1975) | Sociology (Durkheim) | Academic & social integration drive `institutional_commitment` → `engagement`. Social integration is deliberately weighted lower in ODE context. |
| **Bean & Metzner's Non-Traditional Student Attrition Model** (1985) | Non-traditional students | Environmental factors (`financial_stress`, `weekly_work_hours`, `has_family_responsibilities`) are the **dominant** dropout predictors, outweighing social integration. |
| **Kember's Longitudinal Process Model** (1989) | Distance education | `perceived_cost_benefit` is dynamically updated: students perform ongoing cost-benefit analysis each week. |
| **Transactional Distance Theory** (Moore, 1993) | Distance education | Course-level `structure_level` and `dialogue_frequency` interact with student `learner_autonomy` to produce transactional distance, which modulates engagement and feeds Kember's cost-benefit calculation. |
| **Self-Determination Theory** (Deci & Ryan, 2000) | Psychology | Intrinsic/extrinsic motivation and amotivation (`motivation_type`) as predictors of persistence and goal commitment. |
| **Community of Inquiry** (Garrison et al., 2000) | Online learning | Three presences (`social_presence`, `cognitive_presence`, `teaching_presence`) emerge from weekly interactions and co-evolve with Tinto's integration constructs. |
| **Rovai's Composite Persistence Model** (2003) | Online/distance learning | `digital_literacy`, `self_regulation`, `time_management`, and `institutional_support_access` as persistence factors specific to ODE. |
| **Bäulke et al. Self-Regulation Model** | Psychology | Dropout modeled as a **phased process**: committed → perceived misfit → rumination → info seeking → decision. Tracked via `dropout_phase`. |
| **Agent-Based Social Simulation** (Epstein & Axtell, 1996) | Computational social science | Students form peer networks through forum co-activity; peer influence creates engagement contagion and dropout cascades as emergent phenomena. |

### Factor Clusters (Yıldız et al., 2022)

| Cluster | Attributes | Theoretical Source |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Student Characteristics** | `personality` (Big Five), `goal_commitment`, `ode_beliefs`, `motivation_type` | Tinto, Kember, Costa & McCrae, Deci & Ryan |
| **Student Skills** | `self_regulation`, `digital_literacy`, `time_management`, `learner_autonomy`, `academic_reading_writing` | Rovai (2003), Moore (1993), Bäulke et al. |
| **External Factors** | `is_employed`, `weekly_work_hours`, `financial_stress`, `has_family_responsibilities` | Bean & Metzner (1985), Economic Rationality |
| **Internal Factors** | `academic_integration`, `social_integration`, `self_efficacy`, `institutional_support_access` | Tinto (1975), Bandura (1997), Rovai |
| **Emergent Properties** | `social_presence`, `cognitive_presence`, `teaching_presence`, `network_degree` | Garrison et al. (2000), Epstein & Axtell (1996) |

### Key Design Decision: ODE ≠ Campus

Following Bean & Metzner's central insight, SynthEd explicitly **weights external/environmental factors higher than social integration** in the dropout risk formula. Social integration is capped at 0.80 and contributes only 4% to the engagement composite — reflecting the empirical reality that distance learners rarely build campus-based social bonds.

### Emergent Properties (ABSS)

Unlike the other theories which map to static persona attributes or individual simulation mechanics, Epstein & Axtell's ABSS framework produces **emergent collective phenomena**:

- **Dropout clustering**: Students connected by forum activity influence each other's engagement; when one begins withdrawing, neighbors are more likely to follow.
- **Social stratification**: Employed students with family responsibilities form fewer connections (Bean & Metzner prediction) and thus receive less peer support, creating a reinforcing disadvantage loop.
- **Teaching presence amplification**: In courses with high instructor dialogue, peer networks amplify the effect as students discuss instructor feedback.

## Customization

### Custom Institution Profile

Create a JSON config matching your institution's demographics:

```json
{
  "persona_config": {
    "age_range": [22, 60],
    "employment_rate": 0.80,
    "dropout_base_rate": 0.45
  },
  "reference_statistics": {
    "age_mean": 32.0,
    "dropout_rate": 0.45
  }
}
```

### Adding New Interaction Types

Extend `SimulationEngine._simulate_student_week()` to add new behavioral channels (e.g., mobile app usage, tutoring sessions).
