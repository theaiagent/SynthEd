**Agent-based simulation environment for Open & Distance Learning (ODL) research.** SynthEd generates learning trajectories by combining persona-driven agent modeling with 10 theoretical anchors. Built for researchers in learning analytics, educational data mining, and dropout prediction.

```bash
pip install synthedu
python -c "from synthed.pipeline import SynthEdPipeline; SynthEdPipeline().run(n_students=200)"
```

The repository scripts and development setup are shown in [Quick Start](#quick-start). The `main` branch can contain changes beyond the latest published package; see [Unreleased](CHANGELOG.md#unreleased) before reproducing results across versions.

SynthEd models each student's evolving motivations, decisions, and life context. Calibration fits selected aggregate outcomes; passing validation checks does not establish that every simulated trajectory matches a real learner.

## Why SynthEd?

| Research need | SynthEd support |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Access to learner data** | Generate fictional agents from configurable population distributions |
| **Dropout scenarios** | Adjust model parameters or estimate a base rate from measured targeting curves |
| **Longitudinal data** | Generate weekly interactions from evolving persona, memory and network state |

---

## Key Features

### Simulation Engine
- **10 Theory Modules** -- Tinto, Bean & Metzner, Kember, SDT, Garrison CoI, Moore, Rovai, Baulke, Epstein & Axtell, Gonzalez (+ unavoidable withdrawal mechanism)
- **TheoryModule Protocol** -- 4-phase dispatch (individual, network, post-peer, engagement). Phase-method classes with no-argument constructors are auto-discovered; engagement-only classes require engine instantiation and inclusion in the engagement dispatch list
- **Continuous Persona Spectrum** -- Employment intensity, family responsibility and internet reliability use [0,1] scales. Employment and family responsibility combine zero-valued groups with Beta-distributed positive levels; the model also retains categorical states and decision thresholds
- **Multi-Semester Simulation** -- Carry-over mechanics for engagement, GPA, coping, dropout phases
- **Grade Feedback Loop** -- Raw perceived mastery informs cost-benefit, non-fit perception and competence beliefs; transcript GPA separately applies the configured grade floor

### Calibration & Validation
- **Sobol Sensitivity** -- 68-parameter sensitivity analysis identifying dominant dropout/engagement drivers
- **NSGA-II Calibration** -- Multi-objective optimization with Pareto front, parallel `--workers N` support, adaptive parameter bounds
- **5-Level Validation Suite** -- Conditional checks across distributions, correlations, temporal coherence, synthetic-record uniqueness and optional backstories. The standalone validator supports all five levels; current pipeline inputs omit backstories and outcome labels ([limitations](docs/THEORY.md#-validation-suite)). Available data and reference statistics determine the executed count; grades summarize check pass rates, not external validity

### Configuration
- **InstitutionalConfig** -- 5 institution-level quality parameters that modulate theory constants. `support_services_quality` scales 13 Baulke dropout phase thresholds
- **GradingConfig** -- Beta/Normal/Uniform grade distributions, dual-hurdle pass requirements, exam-only and continuous assessment modes, relative grading with t-score cohort normalization
- **EngineConfig** -- 70 frozen engine constants with validation, overridable via `dataclasses.replace()`
- **PipelineConfig** -- Frozen dataclass grouping 16 pipeline params; the [JSON loading example](docs/GUIDE.md#pipelineconfig-recommended) restores event-week keys and custom carry-over objects for reproducibility

### Data & Integration
- **OULAD Schema Export** -- 7 CSV tables with OULAD column names and ordering; mapped attributes and heuristic click counts do not establish statistical or semantic equivalence to OULAD
- **Optional LLM Enrichment** -- Persona-grounded narrative backstories via OpenAI, Ollama, or any compatible provider
- **Benchmark Reports** -- Customizable default profile with CLI report generation (`--benchmark`)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theaiagent/SynthEd.git
cd SynthEd
pip install -e ".[dev]"              # Dev install (no LLM)
pip install -e ".[dev,llm]"          # Dev install with LLM support
python run_pipeline.py              # 200 students, 14 weeks
python run_pipeline.py --n 500      # Custom population
python run_pipeline.py --oulad      # OULAD-compatible export
python run_pipeline.py --benchmark  # Run default benchmark profile
python run_calibration.py --workers 4  # Parallel NSGA-II calibration
```

```python
from synthed.pipeline import SynthEdPipeline
from synthed.pipeline_config import PipelineConfig

config = PipelineConfig(output_dir="./output", seed=42)
pipeline = SynthEdPipeline(config=config)
report = pipeline.run(n_students=300)
print(f"Dropout: {report['simulation_summary']['dropout_rate']:.1%}")
```

## Use Cases

1. **Dropout Prediction** -- Generate labeled training data with known ground-truth trajectories
2. **Intervention Simulation** -- Model "what-if" scenarios by adjusting population parameters
3. **Synthetic Benchmarking** -- Share clearly labeled simulated datasets and their configurations for reproducible research

> **SynthEd's default generator produces fictional personas.** Outputs are intended for research, development, and educational purposes. Custom input data and optional LLM outputs need their own privacy review; the built-in checks are not a formal privacy guarantee. SynthEd is under active development -- APIs and output formats may change between versions.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup and review requirements.

```bash
ruff check synthed/ tests/ --select E,F,W --ignore E501
python -m pytest tests/ -q --tb=short
python -m synthed.doc_facts
```

## Test Suite

[THEORY.md](docs/THEORY.md#-test-suite) contains the generated test inventory. `python -m synthed.doc_facts` checks the source-derived inventory and documented parameter counts. Actual pytest collection and skips depend on installed optional dependencies and browser availability. The CI badge uses a JUnit total that includes skipped entries; consult the CI job summary for the passed/skipped breakdown.
